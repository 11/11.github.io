# Forking

### Why Fork?
This website site is built using a react-like library called <a href="#">Lit-Element</a>. The Lit-Element library is a small library that was created on top of newly added browser feature reffered to as Browser Web-components. Browser Web-components are an up and coming tool that more professional sites are looking to use every day. The main benefit to Browser Web-components is that it's an agreed upon front-end framework like feature that is native to the browser - meaning that's more optimized by browser vendors, and better supported by all user platforms. Forking this project is helping developers move away from commericialized front-end frameworks, like React and Angular, and giving developers other open-source professional alternatives that are optimized for browser performance.

### Upon Forking
All that is asked when forking this project is credit for the core code and theme in the comments of the homepage.
