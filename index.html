			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a computer science major with a concentration in computer graphics at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. I am strong believer in self improvement and tend to find myself always learning for the sake of learning. In the free time I make for myself, I try to fill it by building a foundation on the wide range of interests that I have; these interests being: creating video games, studying philosophy, designing websites, rubiks cubing, coding in hackathons, teaching, playing firsbee, and filming slow motion videos.  

			Outside of my hobbies, I enjoy working on projects involving graphics, mathematics, databases, servers, Linux systems, and web applications. Checkout out more of my work <a herf="#work">below </a> or my projects on <a href="https://github.com/11">github</a>

			<h3>Computer Graphics Research</h3>
			<p>
I work underneath Ph.D Dr. Bahman Kalantari as a developer on his polynomiogrpahy computer graphics research. As a researcher, it is my job to develop multiplatform applications that visualize several polynomiographic algorithms for Android, iOS, and HTML. While developing these applications, I am specifically responsible for creating interactive screens for each polynomiographic algorithm, responsive user interfaces, and a website that allows users to share their visualized creations.

			<h3>EduScape</h3>
			<p>A proof-of-concept web application created in 24 hours at HackPSU 2015. It provides a competitive, gamified addition to traditional grading. With a goal to tie into products that implement LTI, it was intended that classrooms and university's may use the tool to improve a student's drive to do well. 

EduScape goes beyond just providing a point system for grades. It also reveals anonymous student rankings in classes, and allows students to challenge one another to see who can get the better grade with the added risk of wagering your points.

We believed that by breeding competition, we would breed scholars. 

The idea and implementation was met with postive responses form judges and students alike who stopped by at our expo table. Implementation was built using Microsoft Azure (running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), PostgreSQL, Nginx, Java Play Framework 2.3.1less</p>
