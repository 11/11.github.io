			<h3>Computer Graphics Researcher</h3>
			<p>
I work underneath Ph.D Dr. Bahman Kalantari as a developer on his polynomiogrpahy computer graphics research. As a researcher, it is my job to develop multiplatform applications that visualize several polynomiographic algorithms for Android, iOS, and HTML. While developing these applications, I am specifically responsible for creating interactive screens for each polynomiographic algorithm, responsive user interfaces, and a website that allows users to share their visualized creations

			<h3>Recitation Leader & Code Red Tutor</h3>
			<p>As a recitation instructor, it is my job to answer questions and solidify concepts that are taught during weekly CS 111 lectures. Outside of the classroom, I also hold weekly office hours where students may come to me privately and seek out one-on-one help with homework, assignments, and general questions.Code Red is a tutoring service where incoming CS students can meet once a week with a qualified upperclassman that offer one-on-one tutoring in Introduction to CS through Java - 111 as well as Design & Analysis of Algorithms - 112. </p>

			<h3>Dynamo</h3>
			<p>Dynamo was a winning project created in 36 hours at HackNY Fall, 2016 winning most self reliant hack. Dynamo is chrome extension that is designed to be your personal agenda. Dynamo sets itself apart from other to-do list apps because of its ability to repriotize tasks based on progress and due date. The technology behind Dynamo was HTML/CSS/JS and caters to both mobile and desktop platforms.</p>

			<h3>EduScape</h3>
			<p>EduScape was a awarded web application created in 24 hours at HackPSU Spring, 2015 winning a Microsoft honorable mention runner up prize. EduScape provides a competitive, gamified addition to traditional grading. With a goal to tie into products that implement LTI, it was intended that classrooms and university's may use the tool to improve a student's drive to do well. EduScape goes beyond just providing a point system for grades. It also reveals anonymous student rankings in classes, and allows students to challenge one another to see who can get the better grade with the added risk of wagering your points. Implementation was built using Microsoft Azure (running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), PostgreSQL, Nginx, Java Play Framework 2.3.1less</p>

			<h3>Google Feud</h3>
			<p>Google Feud is an web-app game that borrows the Family Feud game show theme and web scraping technology that pulls information from  Google's auto-complete data. The game play involves the user selecting a topic of their choce, where then the game generates a funny half-completed google query. With this information, the application scrapes google for the top 8 search result for the user to guess. If guessed correctly, the player gets to move on to until their streak runs out. </p>

			<p>The Rutgers USACS website is a domain where people can come to learn about the Rutgers CS community and seek out how to get involved with the larger projects that USACS offer. USACS, formally known as the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists, is a Computer Science interest group at Rutgers University. USACS primarily exists as a club that strings together a series of events for the Rutgers CS community; such as HackRU as well as the Rutgers CS Mentor program. </p>

			<h3>Base-sis</h3>
			<p>Base-sis is a music and graphics application that takes in a audio file as input and generates visuals along with the base notes to the song that is playing. Base-sis uses the Minim Music API to where it runs a fast fourier transform on the song data to seek out what frames of music store a lower frequency when compared to other frames. When the Minim API detects a base note, light meshes are rendered by utilizing LibGDX's Box2DLights API. </p>

			<h3>GG-Engine</h3>
			<p>GG-Engine is a complete Java 2D Platformer game engine written using LibGDX and the Box2D physics frameworks. GG-Engine was designed with developers and content creators in mind. The engine itself is completely open source and was structured to allow developers to adopt and build right on top of the code base at a high level. As for designers, the engine comes with support for GUI tools such as Tiled Map Editor, and Box2D to allow for non-programmers to design levels and physics related puzzles.</p>
