				<h3>HackPSU - Spring, 2015</h3>
				<h3>Microsoft Honorable Mention</h3>
			</div>
			<p>EduScape was an awarded web application created in 24 hours at HackPSU Spring, 2015 winning a Microsoft honorable mention runner up prize. EduScape provides a competitive, gamified addition to traditional grading. With a goal to tie into products that implement LTI, it was intended that classrooms and university's may use the tool to improve a student's drive to do well. EduScape goes beyond just providing a point system for grades. It also reveals anonymous student rankings in classes, and allows students to challenge one another to see who can get the better grade with the added risk of wagering your points. Implementation was built using Microsoft Azure (running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), PostgreSQL, Nginx, Java Play Framework 2.3.1less</p>

			<p>Base-sis is a music and graphics application that takes in a audio file as input and generates visuals along with the base notes to the song that is playing. Base-sis uses the Minim Music API to where it runs a fast fourier transform on the song data to seek out what frames of music store a lower frequency when compared to other frames. When the Minim API detects a base note, light meshes are rendered by utilizing LibGDX's Box2DLights API. </p>
