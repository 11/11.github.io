			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a computer science major with a concentration in computer graphics at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. I am strong believer in self improvement and tend to find myself always learning for the sake of learning. In the free time I make for myself, I try to fill it by building a foundation on the wide range of interests that I have; these interests being: creating video games, studying philosophy, designing websites, rubiks cubing, coding in hackathons, teaching, playing firsbee, and filming slow motion videos.  

			Outside of my hobbies, I enjoy working on projects involving graphics, mathematics, databases, servers, Linux systems, and web applications. Checkout out more of my work <a herf="#work">below </a> or my projects on <a href="https://github.com/TheRealDoug">github</a>
