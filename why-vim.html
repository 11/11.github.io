            <h2>Why VIm?</h2>
            <span>Posted 3 days ago on June 15th, 2017</span>

            <p>
            VIm is a text editor that has been around since the beginning and has really stood the test of time. 
            With the creation of more modern text editors like Sublime Text and even just improved ports of VIm,
            such as Emacs, why is there still a large group of VIm users?

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    It all started in a database class during my sophomore year of college when studying computer 
                    science; and at the time, I was zoning out in class - as you do throughout a 3 hour lecture. 
                    And I guess the professor must have been talking about something boring because I felt unmotivated 
                    to listen to every detail of his lecture. After several minutes of dozing off and trying to just take 
                    a small break without being spotted, I see my professor quickly open VIm to edit an SQL file that he 
                    had written as a demo for our lecture. Without hesitation, my professor jumps through several lines 
                    of code and quickly goes in and out of his editor in under 20 seconds. “What did he write you might 
                    ask?”, well, it was Perl script that systematically made changes to an SQL file. And while that 
                    might have taken me several minutes to write, to him it was just an old flick of the wrist. Now 
                    real quick, for those of you who have never seen someone with the slightest bit of experience 
                    work with VIm … let this sink in.

                    <br/><br/><br/>
                    <img src="vim-gif.gif" align="middle"/> 
                    <br/><br/><br/>

                    You can see how he regained my attention. Typing in VIm is not the same as other editors, it’s 
                    so … agile … so exuberant. It enables you to navigate quickly and be dynamic. It lets you think on 
                    levels beyond the text. It’s truly a language itself, one where, if spoken correctly, 
                    can be productive. This my friends, is VIm. 

                    So back in the day, I was using nano, a small, simple, and approachable editor that many noobs 
                    <i>(like myself)</i> pick up when they first start toying within a unix shell. And let me tell you, 
                    there is nothing special to this editor. It can save, copy/paste, and well, it can jump to line 
                    numbers. And that’s ...  really about all it can do. Here let me show you

                    <br/><br/><br/>
                    <img src="nano.gif" align="middle"/> 
                    <br/><br/><br/>

                    And you see, I can already tell some of you are thinking, “How long does it take to learn VIm? 
                    Why not just learn other text editors like Sublime? Why not just use an IDE? y u no Emacs?"
                    While all these questions are valid, everyone dances around the core question that all these 
                    converge towards. So let me propose this question to you; Why Vim?   

                    You see, I get asked this question a lot when I try to share my admiration and excitement
                    for VIm. Often times, people look at me like I have four heads when I try to explain how 
                    the equivalent of a cat walking along your keyboard can somehow optimizes your work flow by what 
                    probably is 4 minutes. And while some people might think I invest too much time into something arbitrarily 
                    meaningless, getting familiar with VIm is arguably one of my most productive hobbies that I have learned. 
                    So with all this said, I’m trying to make it my job to explain the answer to the question, 
                    “Why VIm?” And as long as you are capable of looking past some odd quirks in the beginning, 
                    then hopefully by the end of this blog, I would have convinced you to at least appreciate 
                    Vim from a fresh and open perspective. Okay? Okay.

                <h2>The First Law of VIm</h2>
                <p>
                	So the first thing to learn about Vim, “is why invest all this time?” - and rather explaining 
                    why you should study Vim by showing off interesting short cuts, or by detailing how customizable 
                    Vim truly is, I think it’s more useful to take a moment to simply contrast Vim with other text 
                    editors, and explain what other text editors are doing differently. 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    Now before I get to this topic, I want to add a disclaimer. I don’t want to spend too much time 
                    on this because I think A.) I will probably start a war with an audience who is surfing the 
                    internet with soul intent to defend what is their motherland - Emacs users, I’m looking at 
                    you, and B.) to simply put it, other text editors were built with different intentions in 
                    mind, and those creations were meant to be used by a wide spectrum of users. So really, what 
                    you should be taking away from this is not, “Why are other text editors bad”, but rather, 
                    “What is Vim’s purpose in the text editing realm”. Now with that out of the way, what are 
                    other text editors doing differently and why should you the reader care?
 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    As an attempt to explain Vim’s unique perspective, I’m going start off by comparing Vim to 
                    it’s second cousin Emacs. Okay, it’s hard to talk about this subject without mentioning the 
                    history and relationship Vim and Emacs have, because … well … these two text editors have 
                    been in a 10 year long war, and it’s vital to address this. You see, what makes this specific 
                    topic so interesting is that Emacs, at least in the classical sense, is the superior text 
                    editor to Vim in every way possible way; and I’ll be the first to comfortably admit this fact. 
                    No matter how much you love Vim, and no matter the reason you might hate the Emacs user base, 
                    Vim is only a subset of Emacs, and it’s a fact that has to be accepted as a Vim user. 
 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    Okay, I know, you didn’t see this coming; but let’s pause - and please, just hear me out.  
                    Emacs was developed and released to the public in the year 2005, and was designed with the 
                    original intent of being an operating system. With the scope of a project that vast, you can 
                    imagine why Emacs gets so much praise. It’s often referred to as a behemoth for a reason, and 
                    a well thought out one at that. 
 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    And you see, why Emacs does get all this praise, I want to propose the question I asked you early, 
                    “Why Vim?” - and the answer to this directly correlates with the problem Emacs tries to solve.  
 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    So Emacs, once decided it should to be a text editor, was gracefully designed to be a text editor 
                    you never had to leave. Emacs was given a terminal emulator so that you can compile your code in 
                    parallel on the same window. Emacs includes its own window managing system so that you can look 
                    at as much text as you need. And all the while these features were implemented to simply increase 
                    productivity, it’s easy to forget that these tools are slow to load, and are just one more thing 
                    to memorize; and this is where Vim and Emacs diverge. While Emacs is designed to essentially be 
                    a text based OS, vim thrives on being small, agile, and fast. The features that come with Emacs 
                    are often times unnecessary, and are a core reason as to why Vim is still alive and well. 
 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    And don’t think I don’t know that some of you whom are professional Emacs users are asking 
                    yourselves, “Who wouldn’t you want a working terminal emulator, a highly accurate Vim keyboard layout, 
                    a personal notepad, customizable config files via a Lisp dialect, and about 1.7 more gigabytes of 
                    highly detailed features?” But that’s just it, <b>Vim is for the minimalist, while Emacs is for the 
                    bold.</b> This right here is <i>the first law of Vim</i>; and I think both Vim and Emacs users often forget 
                    this. And while it may be true that Vim has extensions, which has the potential to make Vim just 
                    as clunky and slow as Emacs, these concepts are contrasting the core differences between both vanilla 
                    releases of either text editor. 
 
                    <br/><br/> 
                    So yeah, Vim is designed to be lightweight and is capable of being used in situations that really no 
                    other text editor is as good at. The most famous of these situations is trying to code on server. 
                    You see, when a developer SSHs into a server, it is possible to use Emacs, but what makes Vim so 
                    much better for this problem is that Vim doesn’t slow down as you open more files. Vim is such 
                    a small project in terms of the amount of RAM it takes up, that opening 15 within a single Vim 
                    session is really not an issue. And while Emacs can compete in this task with maybe two to three 
                    files, the more connections Emacs has to handle, the slower the application gets.

                    <br/><br/>
