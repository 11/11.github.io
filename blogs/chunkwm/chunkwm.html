            <span>Posted on July 26th, 2018</span>
            <p>
                This blog post goes through the process of downloading a tiling window manager (TWM) on OS X and how
                it can optimize your work flow.

                <h2> Introduction </h2>
                    <p>
                        I recently had to start using OS X for work, and as a former linux user, I felt something missing from my workflow.
                        OS X is often thought of as a more capable and professional linux machine, yet I still miss that ability to personalize
                        the user experience to my liking. Sure, Linux can be finicky, but having complete control is a privilege that you adjust
                        to real fast. So, while I can’t use Linux at work, I can cover up my problems with software that makes me feel more at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So - without further ado, may I present: ChunkWM.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div id="what-is-chunkwm">
                <h2> What is ChunkWM </h2>
                <p>
                    ChunkWM is a tiling window manager, and for those of you that don’t know what that is - here … just take a look at this:
                </p>

                <img src="chunkwm-gif.gif" alt="chunkwm-gif" align="middle" width="640" height="480"/>

                <p>
                    As you can see, it’s easier to watch a gif rather than read an explanation.
                    But in essence, ChunkWM is a piece of software that manages the layout of all your windows. And
                    while it is possible to work with ChunkWM like vanilla OS X, the more compelling
                    aspect is the ability to navigate around windows with just your keyboard.

                <h2> Installing ChunkWM </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing ChunkWM is quite simple. The only thing you need before hand is <code>homebrew</code> and some patience.
                    In order to set up ChunkWM, we are going to need to install two pieces of software:
                    <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">SKHD</a> and
                    <a href="https://github.com/crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm">Homebrew-ChunkWM</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quick overview: <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">SKHD</a> and is piece of software
                    that listens to our keyboard inputs while <a href="https://github.com/crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm">ChunkWM</a>
					is what manages how our windows are laid out. Together, they listen to our keyboard for
                    <a href="https://github.com/crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm">ChunkWM</a> commands and convert those commands into
                    different actions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, the first thing that we need to do is clone the <a href="https://github.com/crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm">ChunkWM</a>
                    repository from GitHub. To do this with brew, type out:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
<pre>
doug@root-user$ brew tap crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm
</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This downloads the OS X version of ChunkWM. After cloning the repo, you should see a
                    <code>chunkwm</code> directory if you run <code>ls /usr/local/Cellar/</code>.
                    If cloning ChunkWM did not work for you, give <a href="#">this section</a> a glance.
                    If this did work for you, well good job. Now all that is left is to install ChunkWM with:
                    <code> brew install chunkwm </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If all goes well when installing, you should see a message that prints something along the lines of:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
<pre>
Copy the example configuration into your home directory:

    cp /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/share/chunkwm/examples/chunkwmrc ~/.chunkwmrc


Opening chunkwm will prompt for Accessibility API permissions. After access
has been granted, the application must be restarted with:

    brew services restart chunkwm


This has to be done after every update to chunkwm, unless you codesign the
binary with self-signed certificate before restarting Create code signing
certificate named “chunkwm-cert” using Keychain Access.app

    codesign -fs “chunkwm-cert” /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/bin/chunkwm


NOTE: options “--with-logging” and “--with-tmp-logging” are deprecated since now
chunkwm supports logging through configuration:

    chunkc core::log_file <stdout | stderr | /path/to/file>


NOTE: plugins folder has been moved to /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/share/chunkwm/plugins
To have launchd start crisidev/chunkwm/chunkwm now and restart at login:

    brew services start crisidev/chunkwm/chunkwm

Or, if you don’t want/need a background service you can just run:

    chunkwm
</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Copy the first command and run it:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
<pre>
doug@root-user$ cp /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/share/chunkwm/examples/chunkwmrc ~/.chunkwmrc
</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This command will create a <code>.chunkwrc</code> file inside your home directory. Just for good measure, we are gonna want to
                    make sure our <code>.chunkwmrc</code> is executable - otherwise, ChunkWM will not run correctly. To do this, type out:
                    <code> chmod +x ~/.chunkwmrc </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we are also going to want to system link the plugins folder to our home directory. Note - this isn’t
                    necessary in the latest build, but we’re going to do this just for good measure.
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
<pre>
doug@root-user$ ln -sf /usr/local/opt/chunkwm/share/chunkwm/plugins ~/.chunkwm_plugins
</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Good job! You’ve installed chunkwm. To make sure everything was done correctly, running ChunkWM
                    should result in windows auto-scaling to your screen. To test this, type out:
                    <code>brew services start chunkwm</code>. Doing this should bring up an OS X prompt asking you to
                    allow for ChunkWM to be apart of the accessibility list. Allow ChunkWM to be in your accessibility
                    list. Once you do so, restart ChunkWM by typing: <code> brew services restart chunkwm </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After doing so, any program you open should look like this:
                </p>

        <div id="installing-skhd">
            <h2> Installing SKHD </h2>
                <p>
                    If you’ve made it this far, the hard part is over! All that is left is to install SKHD. To do this, run:
                    <code> brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And just like before, brew is going to output a message:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
MESSAGE HERE
                </div>
                <p>
                    From this message, we are going to run:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
<pre>
doug@root-user$ cp /usr/local/Cellar/skhd/examples/skhdrc ~/.skhdrc
</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    And just like before, to start running SKHD, we are going to run: <code>brew services start skhd</code>.
                    This will again prompt you to add SKHD to your accessibility list - do so and restart SKHD with:
                    <code> brew services restart skhd </code> If all goes well, you should be able to
                    rotate two or more windows with the following command: <code>option + r</code>.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    If installing SKHD didn't work, check that you copied the <code>.skhdrc</code> file correctly and that
                    SKHD is in your accessibility list. If that doesn't fix the issue, the
