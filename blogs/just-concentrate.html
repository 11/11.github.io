                    <h2>The Logical Path to Beating Self-Doubt</h2>
                    <p>
                        As an ambitious twenty something looking to be more than a software engineer, I always feel as if Iâ€™m
                        the slowest of my peers to progress my career forward. Thinking as such, I often tie these thoughts
                        to my past experiences, pondering if I had just tried harder in high school, or if I applied for
                        internships as a freshman, my career as an engineer might have been different.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The truth is no matter what I wish I had done, my career is in whatever state itâ€™s in - and
                        that wonâ€™t change with self-doubt.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If I take a moment to consider the time required for me to achieve any of my personal milestones,
                        in there exists hard work, feelings of missed opportunity, and moments of self reflection.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The more I consider how I compartmentalize my time, I begin to realize that it is my ability to focus that enables me to
                        reach my goals; regardless if said work was put in at the age of ten or the age of twenty two, there
                        was work I as an individual had to overcome.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And even if I didnâ€™t think about it in the moment, there was probably someone over analyzing their
                        experiences against mine, wondering what it took for me gain any form of success.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Too many times, I catch myself contrasting my professional opportunities, and if I simply just
                        concentrate on the next goal, rather than contemplating how I compare, Iâ€™d probably be
                        farther than where I am right now.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thus, while the cause of my self-doubt is inspired by my deepest insecurities, overcoming it is an activity
                        that requires acceptance of my past, and finding the strength to neglect my fears.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So whenever you experience self-doubt, just concentrate - inevitably you'll find success.
