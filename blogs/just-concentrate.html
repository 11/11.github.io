                <h2>The Logical Path to Beating Self-Doubt</h2>
                <p>
                    As an ambitious twenty something looking to be more than a software engineer, I always feel as if I’m
                    the slowest of my peers to progress my career forward. Thinking as such, I often tie these thoughts
                    to my past experiences, pondering if I had just tried harder in high school, or if I applied for
                    internships as a freshman, my career as an engineer might have been different.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The truth is no matter what I wish I had done, my career is in whatever state it’s in - and
                    that won’t change with self-doubt.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I take a moment to consider the time required for me to achieve any of my personal milestones,
                    in there exists hard work, feelings of missed opportunity, and moments of self reflection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The more I consider how I compartmentalize my time, I begin to realize that it is my ability to focus that enables me to
                    reach my goals; regardless if said work was put in at the age of ten or the age of twenty two, there
                    was work I as an individual had to overcome.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And even if I didn’t think about it in the moment, there was probably someone over analyzing their
                    experiences against mine, wondering what it took for me gain any form of success.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Too many times, I catch myself contrasting my professional opportunities, and if I simply just
                    concentrate on the next goal, rather than contemplating how I compare, I’d probably be
                    farther than where I am right now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, while the cause of my self-doubt is inspired by my deepest insecurities, overcoming it is an activity
                    that requires acceptance of my past, and finding the strength to neglect my fears.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So whenever you experience self-doubt, just concentrate - inevitably you'll find success.
