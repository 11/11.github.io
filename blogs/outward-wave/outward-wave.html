                I've come to the conclusion that I'm obsessed with wave animations and it's an actual problem. This
                is the fifth animation where I have used some form of unit circle logic, and I think it's time to create
                something with a little more creativity. With that said, I figure I squeeze one more timed wave animation
                out of me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now while this animation looks a lot like my previous <a href="../dna-helix/dna-helix.html">DNA Helix project</a>
                project, the feel of the wave is a lot different. In the <a href="../dna-helix/dna-helix.html">DNA Helix project</a>
                animation, the waves come off as if they are rotating in a circle, where as this animation's main effect
                is the oscillation in the waves.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, it's time to seek out more ambitious ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                And as always, until next time :)
