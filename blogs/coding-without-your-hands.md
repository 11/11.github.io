During the early months of the Covid-19 outbreak, I started to suffer from a repitive-strian injury (RSI) called Tenosynovitis in both of my hands. Due to the severity of my injury, I took several months off work with the hopes of returning back after physical therapy and a potential surgery. With the newly set CDC quarantine guidelines to stay indoors, as well as having no job ðŸ™ƒ, I decided to use all my free time to research any possible way I could continue working on a computer without typing.

As you could imagine, this was a pretty big deal. I'm only 25 at the time of writing this and I've invested nearly a decade into becoming a developer. My only skill is typing instructions into a computer, and it's not just my day job, but rather my main hobby and an artistic outlet. My sanity for getting through quarantine depended on finding a way to continue typing.

Throughout the months I was off, I tried around 10 different ways to work alongside my injury. I learned to type on a stenography keyboard, I wore every wrist guard one could order on amazon, I went to phsyical therapy, I changed my diet, I bought several traditional erogonmic keyboards, I took daily inflammation supplements, I went to chryotherapy, I attended mindfullness classes, I even considerd if my RSI was a mentally stress-induced injury after reading a book called [The Mindbody Perscription](https://www.amazon.com/Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body-Pain/dp/0446675156). Of all the things I tried, the only thing that allowed me to keep working on my computer was picking up a newly developed dictation software called [Talon voice](https://talonvoice.com/).


### What is Talon Voice?

Talon voice may be better described as an easily hackable voice-command API disguised as user-friendly dictation software. The intended users for this project are developers that can no longer type and want the added talon interface to create custom voice commands.





### A11y

I've come to learn that many developers go through life just

Some other things that also became apparent is that there aren't many stories of developers working through their RSI, there are many types of RSI with each their own road to recovery and risks of becoming chronic, and the technologies that are being developed to address these disablities are extremly new. I've grown a whole new appreciation for the a11y initiative for trying to make the web more accessible.

In this article, I will show you how Talon works, how you can customize it,
