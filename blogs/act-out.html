                    No one said that you have to be the person that you were five minutes ago. No one said that you can’t
                    try to stand out. No one is telling you to do anything, it’s only you agreeing with the people that
                    tell you things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me share something with you. When I was six I was placed into remedial classes because I read twice
                    as slow. When I was seven, I went to speech classes because I couldn’t pronounce my T’s without an H.
                    When I was in fifth grade, it was the first and only time I ever got straight A’s. When I was in seventh
                    grade, I failed three courses. When I was in eighth grade, I failed 5 courses. When I hit high school, I
                    was back in remedial classes to compensate for my performance. When I took the SAT i got a 1250/2400 …
                    to only get a 1230/2400 after studying. When I applied to college, my guidance counselor told me,
                    “students with your grades end up at a gas station.” When I tried to transfer, my parents told me I
                    wouldn't make it at Rutgers. When I applied to internships I was rejected 236 times - not one gave
                    me an interview.My entire academic career was shit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was considered a dud, a failure, an example of what not to do. And if I had actually believed that,
                    I wouldn’t have a job and I most definitely wouldn't be in NY. School, no matter how many people
                    pride themselves on their academic accomplishments, is for the mindless souls who’d rather follow
                    directions than think for themselves. Sure, I might not know the fiftteenth  president from rote
                    memorization, but I act on my own accord.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m sitting here writing this because my <i>friends</i> remind me of my incompetence.
                    I thinking about because I constantly toggle between a high and low ego.
                    writing this because everyday I reflect on these past experiences, and see just how prejudice this
                    world is to people who are lost or misguided.
