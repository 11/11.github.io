                    No one said that you have to be the person that were you five minutes ago. No one said that you can’t
                    try to stand out. No one is telling you to do anything, it’s only you agreeing with the people that
                    tell you things.

                    Let me share something with you. When I was six I was placed into remedial classes because I read twice
                    as slow. When I was seven, I went to speech classes because I couldn’t pronounce my T’s without an H.
                    When I was in fifth grade, it was the first and only time I ever got straight A’s. When I was in seventh
                    grade, I failed three courses. When I was in 8th grade, I failed 5 courses. When I hit high school, I
                    was back in remedial classes to compensate for my performance. When I took the SAT i got a 1250/2400 …
                    to only get a 1230/2400 after studying. When I applied to college, my guidance counselor told me,
                    “students with your grades end up at a gas station.” When I applied to internships I was rejected
                    236 times - not one gave me an interview.

                    My entire academic career was shit. I was considered a dud, a failure, an example of what not to do.
                    If I had actually believed that, I wouldn’t be where I am right now. School, no matter how many people
                    pride themselves on their academic accomplishments, is for the mindless souls who’d rather follow
                    directions than think for themselves. Sure, I might not know the fiftteenth  president from rote
                    memorization, but I know how to think for myself.

                    When I come into work, I see people from a variety of backgrounds, yet the one commonality underneath
                    it all is a good student who had the opportunity and or the privilege to attend a great school all the
                    while encouraged by their family to do well. Knowing this, I identify with no one. No one knows what it
                    was like to have to pull your thirty-fifth all nighter during the semester because you barely read a text
                    that is slightly above a high school reading level.

                    I’m sitting here writing this because I was told by my friends that I’m incompetent. I’m writing this
                    because everyday I think about these thoughts, and I’m tired of being someone who blends into your day
                    to day. I’m tired of being seen as someone who doesn’t deserve your attention. I’m sick of being
