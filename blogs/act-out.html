                    No one said that you have to be the person that you were five minutes ago. No one said that you can’t
                    try to stand out. No one is telling you to do anything, it’s only you agreeing with people's
                    perception of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me share something with you. When I was six I was placed into remedial classes because I read twice
                    as slow. When I was seven, I went to speech classes because I couldn’t pronounce my T’s without an H.
                    When I was in fifth grade, it was the first and only time I ever got straight A’s in non-remedial classes.
                    When I was in seventh grade, I failed three courses. When I was in eighth grade, I failed 5 courses.
                    When I hit high school, I was back in remedial classes to compensate for my performance.
                    When I took the SAT I got a 1250/2400 … to only get a 1230/2400 my second time. When I applied to
                    college, my guidance counselor told me, “students with your grades end up at a gas station.” When
                    I tried to transfer to another university, my parents told me I wouldn't make it. When I applied to
                    internships I was rejected 130 times - not one even gave me an interview. My entire academic career
                    was trash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was considered a dud, a failure, an example of what not to do - and if I had actually believed that,
                    I wouldn’t have a job, and I most definitely wouldn't be in NY. School, no matter how many people
                    pride themselves on their academic accomplishments, is for the mindless souls who’d rather follow
                    directions than think for themselves. Sure, I might not know the 23rd president from rote
                    memorization, but I act on my own accord.

                    I’m sitting here writing this because of my peers who remind me of my prior <i>incompetence</i>.
                    I've have more recently been thinking about this because I used to toggle between a high and low self-esteem.
                    If you in anyway can relate to this, this post is for you. I'm writing this because everyday I
                    use to reflect on these past experiences and see just how prejudice this world is to people who are
                    lost or misguided. There is often a clear divide between the "Haves" and the "Have-nots," and it's
                    possible for anyone who is a "Have-not" to reach their full potential and be recognized for it.
                    If you've ever gone down the wrong path, internalize it's not too late to change! It's never too
                    late to learn to late to be something you think you're not.

                    The judgment from others fade, as you
                    - yet the minute they start to blend in, the harsh
                    judgment fades.
