                In computer science, recursion is way of programming that is served to be quite useful in certain situations.
                Generally, recursion is considered to be a good problem solving tool when there is a lack of iterative
                approaches for a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recursion in practice is the act of calling the same function within itself and guiding a program through
                a set of if-statements. Recursion as a tool is only made possible through a concept called the
                <code>Call Stack</code>. The <code>Call Stack</code> keeps track of the state for all the variables every time a
                function is called.

                Recursion is often found most useful when creating an algorithm that runs for an undetermined amount of
                time on certain data structures. Some of the classic data structures where it is common to apply recursion
                are lists, trees, graphs.
