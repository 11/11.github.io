            <h1 class="blog-header1">Coding without your Hands</h1>
            <p class="blog-text">During the early months of the Covid-19 outbreak, I started to suffer from a repitive-strian injury (RSI) called Tenosynovitis in both of my hands. Due to the severity of my injury, I took several months off work with the hopes of returning back after physical therapy and a potential surgery. With the newly set CDC quarantine guidelines to stay indoors, as well as having no job ðŸ™ƒ, I decided to use all my free time to research any possible way I could continue working on a computer without typing.</p>
            <p class="blog-text">As you could imagine, this was a pretty big deal. I'm only 25 at the time of writing this and I've invested nearly a decade into becoming a developer. My only skill is typing instructions into a computer, and it's not just my day job, but rather my main hobby and an artistic outlet. My sanity for getting through quarantine depended on finding a way to continue typing.</p>
            <p class="blog-text">Throughout the months I was off, I tried around 10 different ways to work alongside my injury. I learned to type on a stenography keyboard, I wore every wrist guard one could order on amazon, I went to phsyical therapy, I changed my diet, I bought several traditional erogonmic keyboards, I took daily inflammation supplements, I went to chryotherapy, I attended mindfullness classes, I even considerd if my RSI was a mentally stress-induced injury after reading a book called [The Mindbody Perscription](https://www.amazon.com/Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body-Pain/dp/0446675156). Of all the things I tried, the only thing that allowed me to keep working on my computer was picking up a newly developed dictation software called <a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon voice</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-header2">What is Talon Voice?</h3>
            <p class="blog-text">Talon voice may be better described as an easily hackable voice-command API disguised as user-friendly dictation software. The intended users for this project are developers that can no longer type and want the added talon interface to create custom voice commands.</p>>
