              <span> I recently had to start using OS X for work, and as a former Linux user, I felt something missing from my workflow.

                <span> I've come to the conclusion that I'm obsessed with wave animations and it's an actual problem. This is the fifth animation where I have used some form of unit circle logic, and I think it's time to create something with a little more creativity.  </span>
